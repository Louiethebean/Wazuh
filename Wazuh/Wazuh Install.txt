## Installing Wazuh

### Option 1: Wazuh All-in-One Installation Assistant (Recommended for Beginners)

Wazuh provides an interactive script to install the full Wazuh Stack (Manager, Indexer, Dashboard).

```bash
curl -sO https://packages.wazuh.com/4.7/wazuh-install.sh
bash wazuh-install.sh -a
```

- `-a` flag automatically deploys the all-in-one environment.
- You can also run without `-a` for manual options.

## Server Configuration

- Server config file: `/var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf`
- Add rules, decoders, and active responses as needed.
- Configure SSL/TLS encryption for secure agent communications.
- Configure integrations (Slack, Email, PagerDuty) for alert notifications.

## Agent Deployment

### Linux Agent
```bash
curl -s https://packages.wazuh.com/4.x/apt/install.sh | sudo bash
sudo apt install wazuh-agent
```

Configure agent:
```bash
sudo nano /var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf
```
Set the `<server>` tag to point to your Wazuh Manager IP.

Start the agent:
```bash
sudo systemctl enable wazuh-agent
sudo systemctl start wazuh-agent
```

### Windows Agent
1. Download the installer from [https://packages.wazuh.com/4.x/windows/wazuh-agent-4.x.x.msi](https://packages.wazuh.com/4.x/windows/wazuh-agent-4.x.x.msi)
2. During installation, specify the Wazuh Manager IP.
3. Start the Wazuh Agent service from Services Manager.

## Common Commands

| Command | Description |
|:--------|:------------|
| `sudo systemctl status wazuh-manager` | Check manager status |

## Troubleshooting

- **Dashboard unreachable:** Check firewall rules (allow TCP 5601).
- **Agent not connecting:** Confirm server IP and SSL keys match.
- **No logs appearing:** Verify agent is running and properly configured.
- **High memory usage:** Consider tuning Indexer heap settings.

> **Tip:** Always validate logs in `/var/ossec/logs/` for errors!
